## **Some facts:**

- More than 70% of the Earth's surface is covered with water!

- Roughly 50% of the oxygen that we consume is produced by phytoplankton (small algae & cyanobacteria)!

- Thus, processes mediated in aquatic ecosystems are of crucial global importance!

---

## **Did you know that:**

- **1L** seawater contains around **1 billion** microbial cells!

- Microorganisms are the **key players in biogeochemical cycles** for example the carbon cycle with major implications for regulating the climate!

- The total estimated **microbial surface area** is the **largest on this planet**!

This is an epifluorescence microscopy image of a few mL of seawater. It shows the fluorescence of microbial DNA after staining it with a specific dye. In blue colour you can see mainly *Archaea* and in green mainly *Bacteria* after hybridization with a specific FISH probe (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization).
