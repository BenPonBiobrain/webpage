## **Ph.D. thesis defense**
I am excited to announce that I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis *Molecular mechanisms involved in prokaryotic cycling of labile dissolved organic matter in the sea* on Wednesday, May 12th, 2021! A special thanks to my opponent Prof. Martin Polz and the examination committee! It was a fantastic day that I will never forget, and I couldn't have asked for a better outcome!
